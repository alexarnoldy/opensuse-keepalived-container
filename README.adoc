* Clone this repo to the target server: `cd ~; git clone https://github.com/alexarnoldy/opensuse-keepalived-container.git && cd opensuse-keepalived-container`
* Copy nginx-lb1-keepalived.conf or nginx-lb2-keepalived.conf to keepalived.conf 
* Update the keepalived.conf file for this instance; specifically the state, interface, track_interface, priority, and virtual_ipaddress
** Update the virtual_router_id if there seems to be a conflict on the network

NOTE: More than two keepalived instances can be configured. Each successive instance would have a state of "BACKUP" and a unique priority number

* Build the container: `sudo podman build -t opensuse-keepalived-nginx-lb:latest .`
* Run the container: `sudo podman  run -it -d --net=host --privileged --name nginx-lb-keepalived localhost/opensuse-keepalived-nginx-lb:latest`
* Ensure the container is running: `sudo podman ps -a`
** The "STATUS" field should show the amount of time the container has been running
** If the STATUS is EXITED, run the command `sudo podman logs nginx-lb-keepalived` to see the error that stopped the container
* (For the "MASTER" instance) Check that the virtual IP is running: `ip a`
* Ensure the VRRP service is monitoring port 112 on all interfaces: `ss -npr --listening`
* Copy the nginx-lb.service file into place: `sudo cp -p nginx-lb-keepalived.service /etc/systemd/system/`
* Reload systemd: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
* Start and enable the systemd nginx-lb-keepalived.service: `sudo systemctl --now enable nginx-lb-keepalived.service`
* Check the status of the nginx-lb-keepalived.service: `systemctl status nginx-lb-keepalived.service`

IMPORTANT: Updating the configuration requires removing and rebuilding the container
